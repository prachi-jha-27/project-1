🕒 Digital Clock
📌 Description
This project implements a Digital Clock that displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format and updates every second. It's a simple yet practical project to understand how to work with real-time updates and time formatting.

🛠️ Features
Real-time display of system clock

Time format: 24-hour or 12-hour (optional toggle)

Responsive and clean interface (for web version)

Auto-refreshes every second

Can be extended with date, themes, or alarms

🚀 How It Works
The program fetches the current system time using built-in functions (Date() in JS, time.h in C++, or datetime in Python).

It then formats and displays the time in the desired format.

A loop or timer updates the display every second.
